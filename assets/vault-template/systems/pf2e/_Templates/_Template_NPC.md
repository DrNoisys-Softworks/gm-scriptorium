<!-- {braces} = replace with content. Everything above the gm-only
fence is what players see on the site: write it as the PCs know this
person. Omit a section rather than leave its heading empty. -->

## Overview

{Who they are to the PCs, in two or three sentences: role, reputation,
how the party met them.}

## Appearance & Manner

{What the PCs notice first: one physical detail, one habit. Enough to
picture them, not a portrait.}

## History

{What the PCs have heard or learned of their past. Add to it as they
find out more; the true story stays in Secrets below.}

## Related

{The frontmatter `relationships`, readable. One line per tie, grouped;
drop an empty group. The skills write both together; a tie marked
`gm_only: true` goes under Hidden Ties instead.}

- **People:** [[{Name}]] — {how they're tied, e.g. owns the place}
- **Places:** [[{Name}]] — {…}
- **Groups:** [[{Name}]] — {…}
- **Things:** [[{Name}]] — {…}

## Campaign Log

{One bullet per session they appear in, newest last, as the party saw
it: `- **[[Session NN - Title]]** — sold the party the forged writ; let
slip she knows the Bishop.` session-wrapup adds a bullet each session.}

## GM Notes

### Stats

**{Name}** — Creature {level}
{traits: Human, Humanoid, …}

**Perception** {+8}; {senses}
**Languages** {Common}
**Skills** {Diplomacy +10, Society +8}
**Str** {+1}, **Dex** {+2}, **Con** {+1}, **Int** {+0}, **Wis** {+2}, **Cha** {+3}
**Items** {rapier, fine clothes}

**AC** {18}; **Fort** {+7}, **Ref** {+9}, **Will** {+10}
**HP** {45}

**Speed** {25 feet}
**Melee** ◆ {rapier} {+9} ({deadly d8, disarm, finesse}), **Damage** {1d6+3 piercing}
**{Ability}** {◆ / ◆◆ / ↺} {what it does}

**Tactics:** {one or two sentences}

### Playing Them

- **Voice:** {accent, pace, a verbal tic}
- **Tell:** {the gesture you do at the table}
- **Line:** "{something they'd say the first time the PCs meet them}"

### Wants

{What they're after right now, and what they'll do to get it. The
engine of every scene they're in.}

### Knows

- **Will share:** {what they'll tell the PCs, and what it costs}
- **Hides:** {what they won't say, and what would make them say it}

### Under Pressure

{Threatened, bribed, cornered: do they fold, lie, bargain or fight?}

### Hidden Ties

- [[{Name}]] — {the tie the players don't know about (a `gm_only` relationship)}

### Behind the Scenes

{What they were really doing, session by session, where it differs
from the Campaign Log: `- **[[Session NN - Title]]** — the writ was
bait; she reported the party to the Bishop that night.`}

### Secrets

{The truth the players don't have yet. A hidden identity goes in
`gm_aliases` above, so links to it work without showing it.}
