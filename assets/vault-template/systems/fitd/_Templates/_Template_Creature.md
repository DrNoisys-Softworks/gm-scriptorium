<!-- {braces} = replace with content. Everything above the gm-only
fence is what players see on the site, so write it as what the PCs
have seen or learned. Omit a section rather than leave its heading
empty. -->

## What the PCs Know

{What it looks like, and what they've seen it do or heard of it. Rumour
is fine; mark it as rumour.}

## Related

{The frontmatter `relationships`, readable. One line per tie, grouped;
drop an empty group. The skills write both together; a tie marked
`gm_only: true` goes under Hidden Ties instead.}

- **People:** [[{Name}]] — {how they're tied, e.g. owns the place}
- **Places:** [[{Name}]] — {…}
- **Groups:** [[{Name}]] — {…}
- **Things:** [[{Name}]] — {…}

## Encounters

{One bullet per session the party meets it, newest last:
`- **[[Session NN - Title]]** — glimpsed in the flooded crypt; took
Harker's lantern arm.` session-wrapup adds a bullet each session.}

## GM Notes

### Stats

**{Name}** — {one-line look}

**Drives:** {what they want, two or three words each}
**Traits:** {three adjectives}
**Tier** {faction tier, or —} · **Quality** {their gear and training} · **Scale** {alone / a gang of N}
**Good at:** {what they'd roll well at}
**Harm / threat:** {a clock, e.g. "Hunted by the Bluecoats (4)", or none}

### Behaviour

{What it wants, how it hunts or defends, when it flees.}

### Weaknesses

{What hurts it, what drives it off, how the PCs could learn that.}

### Signs It's Near

- {A clue the PCs find before they see it}

### Hidden Ties

- [[{Name}]] — {the tie the players don't know about (a `gm_only` relationship)}

### Behind the Scenes

{What it was really doing, session by session, where that differs
from Encounters.}
