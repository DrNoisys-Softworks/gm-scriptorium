chapter number, C = the chapter's real (unpadded) number as used in

# Chapter CC · Session NN — {Title} — Wrap-Up

> [!info] Source
> {Where this wrap-up's content came from — play notes file, export
> name — and any structural caveat, e.g. "session ended mid-scene."}

## Narrative Recap

{3–5+ paragraphs of campaign prose, every entity `[[wiki-linked]]`.
This section is lifted by the publish tool as the session's
player-facing recap — write it for players.}

## Memorable Moments

{Optional, player-facing. One bold beat line + one italic context
line per moment; block-quote memorable table dialogue with
`— [[Speaker]]` attribution. Omit the section if not wanted.}

<!-- gm-only -->

## GM Notes

### Quick Bullets

{Optional — 5–8 one-line bullets for a fast GM refresher. Omit the
section when the Play Notes already carry a scene list.}

### PC Carry-Forward

#### [[PC Name]] (Player)

- **MAJOR —** {arc-level beat, if any — omit the bullet otherwise}
- **Intent:** {stated plans, unfinished actions}
- **Knows:** {exclusive information gained this session}
- **Relationships:** {shifted NPC ties}
- **Advancement:** {XP/points recorded on the sheet this session
  (unspent total); if none is recorded, say so and leave it for the GM}
- **Resources:** {money, gear, condition changes}

### What Carries Forward

{Bold-lead bullets in every subsection. Omit any empty subsection.
Name every referent in the bullet that uses it — the document, the
person, the reason — these bullets are read cold by session-prep.}

#### Unresolved Threads

{Cliffhangers and live threads. Note spotlight debt with a staleness
counter: "…now four sessions stale."}

#### Player-Stated Intentions

{What the players said they will do next, in their terms.}

#### Pending Consequences

{Decisions made this session whose effects haven't landed yet.}

#### NPCs Needing Follow-Up

{NPCs whose next move or state the GM must decide or track.}

#### Skipped Prep

{Every planned scene that didn't fire, and the clues in it the
players still need.}

### World State

- **In-game date:**
- **Location:**
- **The party knows:**
- **The party still lacks:**
- **Active threats:**
- **Faction posture:**
- **Ticking clocks:**

### Keeper Checklist

- [ ] {forward-looking GM decisions and prep tasks only: scenes to
  write, GM decisions, rules to review, handouts to build, and any
  advancement the notes don't record}

{Resolve items as `- [x] ~~item~~ — resolution`; never delete them.}

### Name Conflicts (export vs. vault canon)

{Only when play notes came from a table-assistant export. Omit
otherwise.}

| Export said | Vault canon | Applied |
|-------------|-------------|---------|

### Cross-Entity Claims

{Only if any. One line per claim: claim → CONFIRMED / REJECTED /
HELD, by whom, written where. Held claims carry an inline
`<!-- UNVERIFIED: {claim} -->` marker for reconcile.}

### World Fact Findings

{Only if any. Per finding: fact — `Domains:` tags — disposition
(**→ Canon** {file} / Deferred / Suppressed as already encoded).}

### Quality Notes

{What worked / what was missing / what to adjust — plus provenance:
name canonicalisations applied, entities deliberately folded rather
than created. Mark any claim in these GM Notes that the Play Notes,
the plan or a named vault file don't support with
`<!-- UNVERIFIED: {claim} -->`; reconcile queues them.}

### Handoff to session-prep

{2–4 sentences: exactly where, when, and in what state the next
session opens.}

### Reconciliation Context

{Appended by reconcile, not by session-wrapup — leave absent until
reconcile runs.}
