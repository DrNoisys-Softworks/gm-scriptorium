Abstract types are never assigned to entities; they exist for
constraint inheritance in the relationship ontology.

## Frontmatter Schemas

### Required Fields (by Entity Type)

Most entity types require `type` and `canon_status`; the exact
per-type set is below. This is exactly what `vault_check.py
frontmatter` enforces via
`schema_rules.REQUIRED_FIELDS` — that mapping is authoritative, and
`tests/test_entity_schema_required_fields.py` checks this block
against it so the two cannot drift silently.

```yaml
npc: [type, canon_status]
pc: [type, canon_status]
location: [type, canon_status]
faction: [type, canon_status]
organization: [type, canon_status]
item: [type, canon_status]
creature: [type, canon_status]
clue: [type, canon_status]
event: [type, canon_status]
document: [type, canon_status]
adventure-brief: [type, canon_status, scope]
session: [type, session_number, status, documents]
session-plan: [type, canon_status, session]
session-play-notes: [type, canon_status, session]
session-wrap-up: [type, canon_status, session]
session-wrapup: [type, canon_status, session]
session_wrap: [type, canon_status, session]
scene: [type, canon_status, scene_type, status]
chapter: [type]
meta: [type]
timeline: [type]
pc_roster: [type]
player-characters: [type]
character-story: [type, canon_status]
campaign_overview: [type, canon_status]
heritage: [type, canon_status]
plan: [type, canon_status, plan_type, chapter]
world_domain: [type, canon_status, domain, status]
world_flags: [type]
```

The roster page is `pc_roster`. `player-characters` is an older name
for it, still accepted; write `pc_roster`.

A `type:` outside this list is a custom type: `vault_check.py
frontmatter` surfaces it as INFO ("no schema rules applied") rather
than enforcing anything against it.

Recommended on every type, though not enforced: `aliases`, `tags`,
`source_document`, `campaign`, `first_appearance`. Write them
anyway — `vault_check.py names` reads `aliases`, and campaign-qa's
audits lean on the rest.

`gm_aliases` (optional list) holds names only the GM should know, such
as a disguised NPC's true name. They resolve `[[links]]` like `aliases`,
but publish-site and mobrpg never show them: both rewrite a GM alias to
the owning page's title before publishing or pushing. Obsidian only
resolves links through `aliases`, so to make such a link work in
Obsidian, list the name under both fields. It still stays off the site.

```yaml
---
type: npc              # From the type hierarchy
canon_status: DRAFT    # DRAFT | AUTHORITATIVE | SUPERSEDED | STUB
aliases: []             # recommended, not enforced
gm_aliases: []          # optional — secret names; resolve links, never published
tags: []                # recommended, not enforced
source_document: ""     # recommended, not enforced
campaign: ""            # recommended, not enforced
first_appearance: ""    # recommended, not enforced — link to scene or session
---
```

### Relationships Block

```yaml
relationships:
  - target: "[[Target Entity Name]]"
    type: member_of       # From _meta/relationship-types.md
    tone: respectful      # friendly | romantic | respectful
                          # professional | hostile | fearful
                          # distrustful | contemptuous | neutral
                          # unknown | complicated
    strength: 7           # 1-10 (1-2 weak, 9-10 defining)
    bidirectional: false
    description: "Serves as lieutenant"
    gm_only: false        # optional; true hides the edge from a published
                          # site (page, relationship graph, search index)
```

Every relationship on a non-PC entity also appears in the body,
readable (a PC's body follows `shared/pc-body-structure.md`): under
`## Related` (grouped People, Places, Groups, Things, one line per
tie), or under `### Hidden Ties` in GM Notes when `gm_only: true`.
Write, change or remove both together.

Extraction defaults: `tone: neutral` and `strength: 5` when the
source is ambiguous; `bidirectional: false` unless inherently
symmetric; a `description` traceable to source text; `gm_only`
omitted unless the edge's *existence* is the secret.

### Publish control fields

Optional, on any entity — how a frontmatter secret or a whole
GM-facing file stays off a player site (`<!-- gm-only -->` has no
meaning in frontmatter).

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `publish` | `false` \| `stub` | `false` — no page in any mode; links to it render as plain text. `stub` — page emitted for navigation, keeping only `publish_include_sections`. |
| `publish_exclude_fields` | array | Fields hidden on **this file only**, merged over the vault's `exclude_fields`. Not re-admitted by a config-level `overrides.fields.*.include`. |
| `publish_include_sections` | array | With `publish: stub` only. Headings to keep; default none. |

Absent, or an unrecognized `publish:` value, means normal
publication.

**PC `live_key`** (optional string, a slug; machine-written). The key the
site stores a PC's live stats under (current HP/SAN, loadouts, party board).
Absent means the slug of the filename, as always. `relink.py` writes it when
it renames a PC, so the stats stay with the character; nothing else sets it
and templates do not carry it.

## Type-Specific Fields

Mirrored into each vault's `_meta/entity-types.md`; migrations diff
the mirror against these entries.

**NPC:** `occupation`, `age`, `gender`, `nationality`, `status`
(alive/dead/missing/unknown), `location` (wiki-link: where they're
usually found), `portrait` (optional)

**PC:** `player_name`, `occupation`, `age`, `gender`, `nationality`,
`status` (alive/dead/missing/unknown), `key_traits`, `portrait` (optional),
`display_meta` (optional array: ordered field names for published site meta row;
defaults to `[occupation, age, nationality]` when omitted), `sheet_source`
(optional string: where the character sheet is kept when it is not in this
file, e.g. `"D&D Beyond"` or `"paper, with the player"`; not shown on the site by default; see
`shared/pc-body-structure.md`)

### PC Body Structure

The PC body-heading hierarchy, the `## Current Status` block spec,
and the Story Companion Convention now live in
`shared/pc-body-structure.md`.

**Character Story:** `character` (wiki-link to the PC), plus
universal fields — no other type-specific attributes. Body is
append-only session sections; see the Story Companion Convention in
`shared/pc-body-structure.md`.

**Location:** `location_type`, `parent_location` (wiki-link),
`atmosphere`, `portrait` (optional). `parent_location` groups the
published Locations listing (fallback: `location_type`).

**Faction/Organization:** `faction_type` (cult, guild, military,
etc.), `goals`, `leadership` (wiki-link), `territory` (wiki-link),
`status` (active/weakened/destroyed/allied/dormant),
`part_of` (wiki-link to the parent body, optional), `portrait`
(optional). `faction_type` groups the published Factions listing.

**Item:** `item_type` (weapon, armor, relic, etc.),
`current_holder` (wiki-link), `origin`, `portrait` (optional)

**Event:** `event_type` (battle, ritual, etc.), `in_game_date` (in-game),
`location` (wiki-link), `participants` (wiki-links), `outcome`

**Clue:** `clue_type` (physical, testimonial, documentary),
`found_at` (wiki-link), `found_by`, `leads_to`, `reliability`,
`discoveryState` (per PC)

**Document:** `doc_type` (letter, journal, map, etc.), `author`,
`date` (when written), `condition`, `current_holder` (wiki-link).
The text itself goes in the body under `## The Text`; an older
`content` field moves there

**Plan:** `plan_type` (arc/scene/investigation/timeline),
`chapter` (wiki-link), `participants` (wiki-links),
`locations` (wiki-links), `leads_to` (wiki-links)

**Adventure Brief:** `scope` (campaign/one-shot/few-shot),
`sessions_estimated`, `continuation_type` (new/new-chapter/new-arc/time-jump/prequel/parallel/new-pcs),
`adventure_shape` (linear/branching/hub-and-spoke/open-node/sandbox),
`system`

**Campaign Overview:** `campaign`, `game_system`, `setting_year`,
`current_game_date`, `genre_tags`, `scope`, `status`, `sessions_played`,
`last_session`, `last_play_date`, `current_arc`, `arcs_planned`,
`current_chapter`, `chapters_planned`, `portrait` (optional)

**Creature:** `creature_type` (beast, undead, aberration, etc.),
`threat_level` (as the PCs judge it), `location` (wiki-link),
`portrait` (optional). `abilities` and `weaknesses` are optional and
publish; keep them in the body's GM Notes to hide them

**Heritage:** `lifespan_range` (min/max age array), `maturity_age`,
`average_height`, `notable_traits`, `portrait` (optional)

**World Domain:** `domain`, `status` (active/stub/inactive),
`summary`, `rules` (array of machine-checkable world rules)

**World Flags:** `last_reviewed`

### The `mobrpg:` node (machine-managed — do not hand-edit)

Entities synced to a mobRPG world carry a `mobrpg:` node written by
the `mobrpg` CLI — a regenerable sync ledger, not authored content;
top-line frontmatter stays the source of truth. Never edit it or
copy it into another entity. mobRPG is canon: `accepted`/`edited`
entities (`review_state`) are refreshed from mobRPG on pull-down;
`pending`/`dismissed` ones keep their vault content. Scalar values
are JSON-encoded (`key: "text"`, `key: null`).

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `world_id` / `external_ref` / `element_id` / `element_kind` | identity anchors (element_id is null until mobRPG accepts) |
| `review_state` | `pending` / `accepted` / `dismissed` / `edited` / `deleted` |
| `content_hash` / `last_synced` / `review_note` | sync bookkeeping |
| `determined` | classifiers derived and sent (mobRPG canon overwrites on edit) |
| `relationships[]` | reified-Event ids keyed by `(predicate, target)` |
| `languages[]` | reserved (populated by the mobRPG skill) |

## Required Relationships
